# Advent of Code 2021


Install dependencies and run jupyter lab:

```shell
pipenv install
pipenv run jupyter lab
```

The notebook imports the code and presents some graphs for the code.

Reformat the python code using black

```shell
pipenv run black .
```

The solutions can only be seen by running:

```shell
pipenv run python sol.py
```
